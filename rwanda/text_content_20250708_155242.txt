Port Assessment
Rwanda is a landlocked country and thus has no coastline or maritime claims. It therefore relies on the ports of Mombasa in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania for most of its imports and exports. To find a sustainable solution to market barriers, Rwanda has established an East Africa inland port through its partnership with Dubai Port.  Rwanda's In-land port named Kigali Logistics Platform offers warehousing services, transportation services, cold store for perishable products and container storage services. It is expected to help Rwanda save up to $50 million from reduction of logistics cost. To support trade and ease transportation of imported cargoes, the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) opened a liaison office in Kigali in July 2013. The office allows importers to track their cargo from Kigali and pay port dues directly at Kigali.
