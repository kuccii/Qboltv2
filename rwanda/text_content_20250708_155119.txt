Services and Supply
Rwanda depends on road, rail or air transport although pipelines are used for moving large volumes of petroleum. The main supply route runs from the Mombasa refinery to Nairobi by a 485 km pipeline and on to Kigali via Uganda by tanker trucks along a 1,250 km road route. Fuel can also be collected from Eldoret terminal in Kenya. Alternative routes exist from Dar es Salaam to Kigali or by rail from Dar es Salaam to Tabora and Isaka and then by road from Isaka to Kigali (452 km). Over-manning, low tariffs, unreliability and system inefficiencies have made commuters prefer road transport even though it is more expensive. Because of high transport costs, insecurity of supply and low-income levels, the population relies heavily on traditional fuels such as fuelwood, charcoal and agricultural by-products, which account for 90% of the country's energy requirements.
Rwanda's major foreign exchange earners include mining, tourism, coffee, and tea, and continued growth in these sectors will be critical for economic development and poverty reduction.
