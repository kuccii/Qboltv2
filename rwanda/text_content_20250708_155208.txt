Rwanda - 5.1 Acronyms and Abbreviations
There are currently no railway lines in Rwanda. However, there are plans to construct a railway line which would link Isaka, Tanzania to Kigali. The investment plan will be implemented during the period 2022 – 2025.
The new railway is supposed to support trade and easy movement of both imports and exports. This will reduce the barrier of Rwanda to trade since it will get more exposed to the neighboring countries.
