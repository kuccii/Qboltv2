Additionally, being such a hilly country there is little flat land.\nThe aviation sector in Rwanda has seen massive growth over the recent years. The sector is regulated by the Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority (RCAA) which manages all aspects of civil aviation in the country. In the recent past, the institution has undergone legal reforms which have greatly impacted the execution of its operations in ensuring safety, security, and infrastructural development.\nKigali International Airport (KIA), formerly known as Gregoire Kayibanda International Airport, is the primary airport serving Kigali, and the only international airport in the country. It is the main air gateway for all destinations in the country, and in addition serves as a transit airport for Goma and Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The airport is in the suburb of Kanombe, at the eastern edge of Kigali, approximately 12 km from the city centre.\nThere has been significant growth in air traffic with the introduction of a number of international airlines to the country. KIA is undergoing expansion to meet the midterm additional capacity requirements. For the longer term, construction is currently underway for construction of a world class international airport – New Bugesera International Airport (NBIA) - which will be located some 40 km from Kigali.\nDomestic air transport is very limited. Regular flights are conducted to Kamembe Airport, while Gisenyi aerodrome is being upgraded.\nFor a list of the airports in Rwanda with details on each, please see the following attachment:\nList of Rwanda Airports\nRwandAir, the national carrier, has in the recent past acquired new aircraft and operates on many routes in Africa and United Arab Emirates. Other airlines operating flights to Kigali include Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, SN Brussels Airline, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and China Postal Airlines.\nNew Bugesera International Airport (NBIA)\nBugesera International Airport is being constructed to accommodate the growth of air traffic in Rwanda. The project will cost approximately US $650 million and will be located 25 km southeast of Kigali. The airport will have capacity for three million passengers per year. The first phase of construction will include the runway of 4,200 m, a cargo terminal and a passenger terminal with capacity for 1.8 million passengers per year.\nNational Airports\nDue to COVID –19, the upgrading of the Airports was delayed hence the situation remains the same as 2016.The domestic airports of Kamembe and Gisenyi/Rubavu, located in the South and Southwest of Rwanda, respectively, it was reported by Rwanda Airports authority that minor rehabilitation works were carried out. The two airports will boost tourism in the mountains for the gorillas and volcanoes and connect the country to Goma in DRC. For more information, please see below.\nRwandan Flyer Website, for more information on government agency and airport company contact information, please see the following links: HQ staff will input a link to sections 4.1 Government Contact List and 4.5 Airport Companies Contact List here.\nProcedures for Foreign Registered Aircraft\nA. company which wishes to register an aircraft in Rwanda shall apply to the RCAA for aircraft\nregistration by submitting a duly completed prescribed application form to the RCAA.\nB.

information may also be found at: <a href=\"https://www.caa.gov.rw/&amp;nbsp\">https://www.caa.gov.rw/&amp;nbsp</a>;</p>\n\n<p>Rwanda being a relatively small country in terms of area and with relatively good quality roads there is not much requirement for many regional airports. Additionally, being such a hilly country there is little flat land. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aviation sector in Rwanda has seen massive growth over the recent years. The sector is regulated by the Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority (RCAA) which manages all aspects of civil aviation in the country. In the recent past, the institution has undergone legal reforms which have greatly impacted the execution of its operations in ensuring safety, security, and infrastructural development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kigali International Airport (KIA), formerly known as Gregoire Kayibanda International Airport, is the primary airport serving Kigali, and the only international airport in the country. It is the main air gateway for all destinations in the country, and in addition serves as a transit airport for Goma and Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The airport is in the suburb of Kanombe, at the eastern edge of Kigali, approximately 12 km from the city centre.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There has been significant growth in air traffic with the introduction of a number of international airlines to the country. KIA is undergoing expansion to meet the midterm additional capacity requirements. For the longer term, construction is currently underway for construction of a world class international airport – New Bugesera International Airport (NBIA) - which will be located some 40 km from Kigali.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Domestic air transport is very limited. Regular flights are conducted to Kamembe Airport, while Gisenyi aerodrome is being upgraded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For a list of the airports in Rwanda with details on each, please see the following attachment: <a href=\"https://dlca.logcluster.org/download/attachments/3801090/List%20of%20Rwanda%20Airports.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1464665663000&amp;api=v2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">List of Rwanda Airports</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>RwandAir, the national carrier, has in the recent past acquired new aircraft and operates on many routes in Africa and United Arab Emirates. Other airlines operating flights to Kigali include Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, SN Brussels Airline, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and China Postal Airlines. &nbsp;<br>\n &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Bugesera International Airport (NBIA)&nbsp;</strong><br>\nBugesera International Airport is being constructed to accommodate the growth of air traffic in Rwanda. The project will cost approximately US $650 million and will be located 25 km southeast of Kigali. The airport will have capacity for three million passengers per year. The first phase of construction will include the runway of 4,200 m, a cargo terminal and a passenger terminal with capacity for 1.8 million passengers per year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>National Airports&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Due to COVID –19, the upgrading of the Airports was delayed hence the situation remains the same as 2016.The domestic airports of Kamembe and Gisenyi/Rubavu, located in the South and Southwest of Rwanda, respectively, it was reported by Rwanda Airports authority that minor rehabilitation works were carried out. The two airports will boost tourism in the mountains for the gorillas and volcanoes and connect the country to Goma in DRC.
