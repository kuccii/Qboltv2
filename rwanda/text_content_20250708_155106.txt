Railway Assessment
There are currently no railway lines in Rwanda. However, there are plans to construct a railway line which would link Isaka, Tanzania to Kigali.
The Government is committed to developing a rail transport system as one of the envisaged solutions to boosting socio-economic development, welfare of Rwandans as well as cutting down the transport costs. At present, two major rail transport corridors connecting the country to the Indian Ocean are in pipeline, with the Northern Corridor running from Mombasa-Nairobi-Kampala to Kigali, and the Central Corridor linking Kigali with Dar Es Salaam. The proposed railway in Rwanda will be a single ballasted, standard gauge system with maximum speed of 120 Kph for passenger and 80 Kph for freight.
