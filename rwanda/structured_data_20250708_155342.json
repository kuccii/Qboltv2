Some specific areas include light vehicle hire and purchase, handling equipment, clearing and forwarding, movers, supply of plastic sheeting, tarpaulin sheets, tents, assembling of Mobile storage units, pest control. Specific issues are mentioned in each of the subsection below.\nWith regard to transport of personnel, there are local representatives of Toyota, Nissan, Isuzi and Suzuki types of vehicles, who are able to supply brand new vehicles.  There are also a few garages to provide vehicle maintenance and repair services.\nAccommodation\nThe housing market is very competitive at the moment, and in all residential areas, most houses would meet the minimum criteria required for UN Agencies. In addition, there are serviced apartments, hotels and guest houses available. The available facilities would be able to support a large influx of demand.\nElectricity and Power\nMINIFRA is responsible for putting in place policies and the strategy of the energy sector and for directing the developments of the electricity sub-sector, whereas the Energy and Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA), a semi-parastatal, is responsible for electricity generation, bulk transmission and distribution and retailing functions on a commercial basis.\nThe Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Authority (RURA) regulates the energy sector, and is involved in policy formulation, protection of consumers, and approving contractual activities amongst others.\nIn October 2013, the government approved the split of EWSA into the Energy Holding Company, which will manage energy development and electricity whereas the Water and Sanitation Company will manage water resources and distribution in the country.\nElectricity in Rwanda is a combination of hydro-electric, oil fired thermal and solar generation which is supplemented with electricity imported from the Ruzizi in DRC 1 & 2 generation plants. Electricity is also imported from Uganda to supply areas in the north along the Ugandan border. The generation capacity of the hydro plants is determined by the water levels of dams during dry periods.\nThe electricity sector has seen very high growth over the recent years, the current target under the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 (EDPRS 2) is 70 percent of households to be connected to the electrical grid by 2017. Rwanda is targeting to generate 563 MW by 2018 while the current generation capacity is about 191 MW. Rwanda consumes only 25.91kWh/year/person (as of 2014) much lower than the average of the sub-Saharan Africa (Source:\nhttp://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=81000\n). Despite the improvements resulting from investments in the energy sector, power outage is still common particularly in areas outside of Kigali. As a result power rationing is exercised by Rwanda Energy Group (REG)\nMore info on the electricity and Power in Rwanda:\nRwanda Development Board Website\nElectricity and Power Summary Table\nProduction Unit\nType\n(Hydroelectric, Thermal, etc.)\nInstalled\nCapacity (MW)\nCurrent Production (MW)\nNtaruka\n11.25\n1.2\nMukungwa\n12.0\n5.0\nRukarara\n9\nOthers (Gihira, Gisenyi, Nkora, Cymbili, Keya, Mazimeru, Rugezi)\n9\nJabana (Heavy Fuel Oil)\nHydroelectric\n20\n6.0\nJabana (Diesel)\nHydroelectric\n7.8\n6.0\n(Aggreko) Gikondo (Rental Thermal Power)\nIn-house Thermal\n14\n14\nKibuye (Methane to Power)\nIn-house Thermal\n25\n25\nRuzizi 1\nRental power\n3.5\nRuzizi 2\nRental power\n12\n8 – 12\nKabale (Uganda)\nRental power\n1\n0.2\nImported Hydro Power\n16.5\nKigali Solar Power\n10.9\n10.9\nThe Rusumo Falls project of 80 MW capacity will increase renewable power generating capacity and access to electricity in Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. Construction of the transmission facilities is expected to be completed by August 2018; the three countries will share the power generated equally.\nMore information can be obtained at:\nRusumo Hydroelectric Project\nPhoto: Construction works at the KivuWatt plant\nWith respect costs, new tariff structure as of September 2015 is as follows:\nThe electricity tariff increased by 35 per cent for low voltage users, including residential and non-residential customers, where the price will go up from Rwf134 per Kilowatt/hour to Rwf182 per kilowatt/hour. For the medium voltage rates (industrial customers), the tariff will remain at Rwf126 per kilowatt/hour.\nThe new tariffs do not include VAT. Web site:\nRwanda Energy Group Website\nTaxi Companies\nCar hire operators are available in Kigali and in major town. Although they may be contracted individually, they are all registered in Cooperatives. A taxi drivers’ Association at Kigali International airport (ATAK) provides transport from the airport to different parts of Kigali town at an estimated cost of US$20 or Rwf10,000 per trip. Other companies have their offices near the airport and are offering good services from the airport to outside the Kigali town at about Rwf 1500 for the first km and Rwf 500 for every extra km covered.\nExpress Taxis run to a set timetable (usually hourly) between major towns, generally Kigali and a major regional centre. The taxis are run by a company (Sotra Tours, Atraco, Stella, Volcanoes Express, Virunga, Trans2000, Omega Car and Muhabura Travel) and issue tickets in advance with a set price. Like stopping taxis, these are minibuses and seat 18 passengers, but they depart on time and do not stop until they reach their destination, except to set people down.\nExpress taxis are quite a recent phenomenon, but are gaining rapidly in popularity as they provide people the security of arriving at a known time. More destinations are being added over time, and most routes sell out considerably in advance of the departure time. Passengers wishing to alight before the end terminus can do so, but have to pay the full ticket price anyway. The price of tickets on Express taxis is similar to the price of a stopping taxi over the same distance.\nInformation on public transport in Kigali can be found on the following link:\nKigali City Website\nInternational public transport:\nThere are several daily coach services from Rwanda to destinations in the Africa Great Lakes (Source:\nWikipedia website for Transport in Rwanda\n)\nJaguar Executive Coaches which connects Kigali to Kampala, via Gatuna border or via Kagitumba border.\nRegional Coaches Services, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi, Kenya (20 hours) and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (36 hours), all via the Gatuna border except Tanzania which uses Rusumo border. These buses are usually air-conditioned.\nTrinity Coach: a Rwandan service, running between Kigali and Kampala.\nThe transport price from Kigali to Kampala varies from 8,000 to 10,000 Rwanda Francs (Rwf) per person depending on the planned hours for travelling.\nTAKWA coach links Kigali to Dar-es-Salam on daily basis at 32,000 rwf per person.\nSIMBA and Kampala Coaches are regularly running from Kigali to Nairobi with an individual transport cost fixed at 27,000 rwf.\nVolcano Express: minibus service running Kigali and Bujumbura, Burundi at a cost of 6,000 rwf. This service has been subject to ambush in the past by rebels in Burundi.\nVehicle Rental\nThere is only one internationally recognised car rental agency in Rwanda, based at Kigali Airport.\nDisclaimer: Inclusion of company information in the LCA does not imply any business relationship between the supplier and WFP / Logistics Cluster, and is used solely as a determinant of services, and capacities.\nPlease note: WFP / Logistics Cluster maintain complete impartiality and are not in a position to endorse, comment on any company's suitability as a reputable service provider.\nBook Navigation\nRwanda - 3.5.1 Food Suppliers\n4 Rwanda Contact Lists\nContact\nAbout the LCA tool\n© 2025.

Kigali in particular and a few in other large towns of Rwanda. Some specific areas include light vehicle hire and purchase, handling equipment, clearing and forwarding, movers, supply of plastic sheeting, tarpaulin sheets, tents, assembling of Mobile storage units, pest control. Specific issues are mentioned in each of the subsection below. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With regard to transport of personnel, there are local representatives of Toyota, Nissan, Isuzi and Suzuki types of vehicles, who are able to supply brand new vehicles.  There are also a few garages to provide vehicle maintenance and repair services. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Accommodation&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The housing market is very competitive at the moment, and in all residential areas, most houses would meet the minimum criteria required for UN Agencies. In addition, there are serviced apartments, hotels and guest houses available. The available facilities would be able to support a large influx of demand. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Electricity and Power&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>MINIFRA is responsible for putting in place policies and the strategy of the energy sector and for directing the developments of the electricity sub-sector, whereas the Energy and Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA), a semi-parastatal, is responsible for electricity generation, bulk transmission and distribution and retailing functions on a commercial basis. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Authority (RURA) regulates the energy sector, and is involved in policy formulation, protection of consumers, and approving contractual activities amongst others. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In October 2013, the government approved the split of EWSA into the Energy Holding Company, which will manage energy development and electricity whereas the Water and Sanitation Company will manage water resources and distribution in the country. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Electricity in Rwanda is a combination of hydro-electric, oil fired thermal and solar generation which is supplemented with electricity imported from the Ruzizi in DRC 1 &amp; 2 generation plants. Electricity is also imported from Uganda to supply areas in the north along the Ugandan border. The generation capacity of the hydro plants is determined by the water levels of dams during dry periods. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The electricity sector has seen very high growth over the recent years, the current target under the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 (EDPRS 2) is 70 percent of households to be connected to the electrical grid by 2017. Rwanda is targeting to generate 563 MW by 2018 while the current generation capacity is about 191 MW. Rwanda consumes only 25.91kWh/year/person (as of 2014) much lower than the average of the sub-Saharan Africa (Source: <a href=\"http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=81000\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=81000</a>). Despite the improvements resulting from investments in the energy sector, power outage is still common particularly in areas outside of Kigali.

Although they may be contracted individually, they are all registered in Cooperatives. A taxi drivers’ Association at Kigali International airport (ATAK) provides transport from the airport to different parts of Kigali town at an estimated cost of US$20 or Rwf10,000 per trip. Other companies have their offices near the airport and are offering good services from the airport to outside the Kigali town at about Rwf 1500 for the first km and Rwf 500 for every extra km covered.   &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Express Taxis run to a set timetable (usually hourly) between major towns, generally Kigali and a major regional centre. The taxis are run by a company (Sotra Tours, Atraco, Stella, Volcanoes Express, Virunga, Trans2000, Omega Car and Muhabura Travel) and issue tickets in advance with a set price. Like stopping taxis, these are minibuses and seat 18 passengers, but they depart on time and do not stop until they reach their destination, except to set people down.  &nbsp;<br>\nExpress taxis are quite a recent phenomenon, but are gaining rapidly in popularity as they provide people the security of arriving at a known time. More destinations are being added over time, and most routes sell out considerably in advance of the departure time. Passengers wishing to alight before the end terminus can do so, but have to pay the full ticket price anyway. The price of tickets on Express taxis is similar to the price of a stopping taxi over the same distance. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information on public transport in Kigali can be found on the following link: <a href=\"https://www.kigalicity.gov.rw/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kigali City Website</a>  &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>International public transport: &nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>There are several daily coach services from Rwanda to destinations in the Africa Great Lakes (Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Rwanda\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia website for Transport in Rwanda</a>) &nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Jaguar Executive Coaches which connects Kigali to Kampala, via Gatuna border or via Kagitumba border.  &nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Regional Coaches Services, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi, Kenya (20 hours) and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (36 hours), all via the Gatuna border except Tanzania which uses Rusumo border.
