The rainfall patterns in Rwanda are characterized by four seasons, a short rainy season from September to November. See
here
.
During the two rainy seasons, the north-western provinces are the most vulnerable areas prone to landslides causing damage and loss of lives. The elevation, slope, poor land management and rainfall are the key drivers for landslides in this area. Rain harvest which could minimize runoff is rarely practiced, impacting livelihoods, killing, or injuring people, and damaging infrastructure, especially roads and bridges, that become impracticable.
Due to its dense river network and large wetlands, the country is threatened mainly by riverine floods. Five flood plain areas have been recorded in the National Risk Atlas of Rwanda related to the following river’s catchment: Nyabarongo, Nyabisindu, Sebeya, Mukungwa and Kagitumba. Nyabarongo River affected more districts than any other river. During the rainy season some parts of roads close to those rivers are submerged by water blocking the passage of vehicles.
Seasonal Effects on Storage and Handling
Activity Type
Time Frame
Comments / Details
Storage
Two main harvest periods: From (December) to (February) and from (June) to (July)
December to February and June to July are the two main harvest periods in Rwanda. During those periods, some smallholder farmers and trades have not appropriate post-harvest handling and storages facilities and these effects of harvested commodities.
Handling
Long rainy season takes place from March to May and short rainy season occurs from September to November.
During Rwanda's rainy season, the country encounters difficulties related to road accessibility, significantly impacting the transportation of goods. The presence of mudslides and flooding disrupts transportation routes, causing challenges in handling and moving goods. Moreover, the poor road conditions during this season lead to an increase in the wear and tear of vehicles. Consequently, adjustments are needed in maintenance schedules and the formulation of contingency plans to address potential vehicle breakdowns.

Capacity and Contacts for In-Country Emergency Response
GOVERNMENT
Rwanda is among the fastest growing economies in Africa with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP, Current) of $10.354 billion, according to the World Bank.
Rwanda’s economy is mostly dependent on agriculture, with coffee and tea serving as two of the country’s most important exports. Tourism has also grown into a significant source of revenue. Infrastructure projects such as roads and airports have seen significant investments made by the country to help enhance economic growth and development.
Despite the progress made in recent years, poverty and food insecurity remain major challenges for Rwanda. Nearly 39 percent of the population live below the poverty line, and almost one-fifth is food insecure. Levels of stunting among young children remain very high, at 35 percent. These statistics underscore the need for continued investment in programs that address poverty and hunger.
The country has made significant progress in recent years in terms of infrastructure development and is now well-positioned to capitalize on its strategic location and improve connectivity within the region.
On the humanitarian side, Rwanda was home to 175,000 Congolese and Burundian refugees by January 2019. Most refugees, 91 percent of reside in refugee camps and only 9 percent live in urban areas.
