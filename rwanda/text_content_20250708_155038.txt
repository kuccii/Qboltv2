To be exempted from paying duties and taxes, the imported goods must be mentioned in article 182 of the customs law.(With the introduction of the ESW, the exemption is done online with the attachment of an invoice, packing list, DDCom/IM8-Customs declaration from the entry point & a copy of the agreement between the GoR and WFP) The clearing agent presents WFP with the RRA Exemption form, a copy of the commercial invoice and packing list.  WFP signs and stamps the form and attaches an Application for an Exemption letter.  The letter of exemption is issued and authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then signed by the Ministry of Finance; this can take up to 10 days after the exemption form and letters have been submitted.
Clearing Documents / Regularisation or Formalisation
With the use of the ESW (Electronic Single Window) All imports will normally be cleared from customs with the attachment of the following documents below which are forwarded to the concerned line ministry, e.g., for Rwanda it’s the ministry of foreign affairs.
 One original Bills of Lading/AWB, one original NCV invoice / original supplier invoice / original packing
list
 Exemption letter authorized by the Government of Rwanda
 MAGERWA (bonded warehouse) creates the ‘Notice of Arrival’
 On approval by the concerned line ministry, it’s forwarded to RRA awaiting the commissioner for customs approval of the exemption which he does by releasing it back to WFP office for assessment. These are then presented to Customs who authorizes it and the goods are released
 On assessing it WFP sends it back to the customs office (Long Room) to enable any payments to be met and to further cross-check for any other missing details with the consent of RBS. When all is fine a print release is facilitated and this is when goods are exited from the system. (Completion of the regularization procedure)
N.B. Because of the various private arrangements, WFP has with RRA all the above is done afterward coupled with the load of the consignment WFP normally tends to have.

Transit Regime
The Customs working hours at the borders are from 07:00 hrs to 18:00 hrs for cargo and 24 hrs per day for passengers (including weekends and holidays) plus trucks with containers save for open trucks with tarpaulins. However, about small and not so busy border posts, the Customs officer might not be found at any time during the day. The gazetted overland border posts for heavy vehicles where Rwanda Customs, Police and Immigration at present are as follows:

Transit Charges
There is a road-toll charge for foreign registered trucks entering Rwanda of $152 per trip, additional to this is a charge of RWF 15,000 ($27) RWF 5,000 ($9.00) which is referred to as the Entry Card Charge for foreign trucks with a non EAC registration number plate e.g. DRC.
The charge for presenting customs documentation is RWF 6,000 ($10) RWF 3,000 ($5.50). There is also a $200 bond charge but there is no requirement for WFP to pay this.
Storage and Handling at Overland Border Posts
Depending on the nature and the physical location of WFP operations at the time, the storage facility of the nearest town or WFP EDP could be considered as an alternative to the border post storage, regarding the borders that do not have a storage facility, for instance:
Location
Distance to Border (kms)
Capacity (Mt)
Description
Byumba (Gatuna)
30
12,000
New secure warehouse operated by Pembe Flour Mills
Alternative Border Storage Options
Generally, the storage facilities are not up to the WFP standards. Therefore, there may be a need for repair and rehabilitation works before use.
Inspection Procedures
Trucks arriving at the border crossing points are checked for appropriateness of documentation and sample checks of the cargo type can be conducted as per international standards and procedures. Rwanda accepts and uses ESW (Electronic Single Window) ASYCUDA (Automatic System for Customs Data); this enables clearance to be kept to a minimum, sometimes as little as only 10 mins.
Customs documents are filled at the entry points and a general inspection is undertaken before trucks are allowed to continue to their destination. Truck movements are monitored by the Anti-Smuggling Unit at each checkpoint until they reach their destination. The Anti-Smuggling Unit evaluates the time trucks spend between checkpoints to check if there was any diversion on the way.
Available Facilities
The border crossing points that are also regional towns (Gisenyi & Cyangugu) all have adequate facilities that drivers require. The other crossing points are not near major towns have basic facilities such as food and lodging, small retail shops, and standby security personnel.
