Transporters
All activities within the road transport sector are managed by the Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA) which operates under the Ministry of Infrastructure (MINIFRA). Within the legal and institutional framework stated in the National Transport Policy, MINIFRA is responsible for the sector policies and strategies.
The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA), which reports directly to the Office of the Prime Minister, whilst playing coordinative role between the MINIFRA and service providers ensures fair competition in the market in addition to ensuring compliance with national transport laws and regulations.
The “Association des Transporteurs Agréés au Rwanda” (ATAR) is an association of private goods transport operators which works in collaboration with the Private sector federation (PSF). The objectives of the association are to support transporters and regulate prices. The transport market in Rwanda has players from neighbouring countries. As a result, there is free competition in the market across all transporters.
With the growing economy and increase of industries production for export, Rwandan freight transporters have also increased their logistical skills and international good practices such as, electronic cargo tracking systems to compete effectively with those in neighbouring countries.
The transport capacity in the market is able to meet local demand, although, very costly. Some of the factors which contribute to this high cost are the limited availability of freight transport companies and high fuel charges. Mostly, trucks owners prefer to operate individually instead of forming companies. Transporters from neighbouring countries are utilised to a great extent for the importation of products and subcontracted by local transporters for export. Long hauliers in Rwanda are involved in exportation of Tea and coffee to neighbouring countries.
The current transport capacity supplemented with operators from neighbouring countries can accommodate an influx in demand from the humanitarian community.
Cross border transport is currently costly due to a number of constraints faced by transporters along the way. In addition, there has been very significant increase in transport costs because of the global fuel crisis, imposition of new axle-load restrictions and customs delays in the region.
