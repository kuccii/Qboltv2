If it is owned by more than one passenger, all passengers must be present when conducting the physical examination. If circumstances do not permit the owner to be present, the one that presents the declaration must know the contents and be ready to answer queries that may arise.\nOnce satisfied that the declaration is correct, the officer should give the travellers the statutory allowances as indicated under the respective regulation. However, should the travellers possess goods beyond the allowances, appropriate duties and taxes must be calculated and collected in prescribed manner.\nFor more information on customs in Rwanda, please see the following link:\n1.3 Customs Information\n.\nStorage Facilities\nUpon arrival of goods at the airport, notice of arrival is given by MAGERWA (Magasin Generaux – “bonded warehouse”) office at the airport to the forwarding agent (F/A) who contacts the consignee. The air waybill is collected from airline and Rwanda air Cargo Office. The F/A completes the customs declaration form with the amount of tax stated with the attached air waybill and commercial invoice.\nAdditionally, other documents such as a Certificate of Origin are attached and presented to the customs officer who checks the tax calculations and completeness of the documents before payment. Handling charges and storage fees are paid to MAGERWA, and the goods are then released. During emergency situations special arrangements can be made at government offices so that goods can be cleared within 3 days.\nAirfield Costs\nNavigation Charges\nFor information on all fees, please see the links below:\nhttps://rac.co.rw/\nhttps://www.caa.gov.rw/\nAIR-BRIDGE CHARGES\nThere are no air bridges in Rwanda.\nSecurity\nSecurity is good both inside and around the terminal. Inside the terminal, the airport security personnel have radio communication and passenger, and luggage screening equipment are well placed.

International Airport, sometimes referred to as Kanombe International Airport, is the main airport serving Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. It is the country's main airport, but it is also of regional importance as it serves Congolese, Burundian and Ugandan cities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The airport is located on the outskirts of Kanombe, southeast of Kigali, about 5 km from the city center by expressway and about 10km from the central business district of the Rwandan capital.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Located at 1491 meters above sea level, its terminal is one of the highest in the world among international airports. Its 3500-meter runway allows landing of all types of aircraft and has allowed the continuous increase of passenger traffic to the 800 000 passengers who passed through it in 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kigali airport has three terminals and two heliports. The main terminal was built to replace the smaller building that now serves as a VIP terminal. The third terminal is the cargo terminal, which enjoys great activity due to the isolation of Rwanda. The latest renovations and modernizations of the airport have allowed it to be in 2017 ranked 7th among the best regional airports in Africa for its fire/safety standards and 2nd in Africa for its compliance with ICAO standards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The topography of Kigali does not allow to extend the capacities of the current airport and the passenger traffic being constantly increasing in Rwanda, a new airport intended to serve the capital and to replace the airport of Kanombe is currently under construction in Bugesera, 40km south of Kigali. The new airport will have only one runway but will have the ability to see a second one built later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In September 2016, the Rwandan government sealed a partnership with the Portuguese company Mota-Engil Engenharia e Construção África. This company is responsible for the construction and for a 25-year management of the airport. The new airport will have at its inauguration a capacity of 1.7 million passengers per year. This capacity will be expandable to 4.5 million passengers once all infrastructure is completed. In exchange Mota-Engil Engenharia and Construção África will cover the costs of 418 million USD for the first phase and 400 million USD for the second phase, a total investment of 818 million US dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<p>Airport Location and

Performance Indicator&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Kigali, 2 June 2020:  The Kigali International Airport is undergoing expansion works to address congestion issues.  The number of flights to and from the airport has outstripped its optimal capacity, calling for expansion as a short-term solution to the increased number of flights and passengers passing through the airport.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Main sections under renovation include the expansion of arrival terminal, runway strip grading, the apron and service road. The new airport apron – an airport parking – is 53,000 square meters with capacity to accommodate 18 aircraft. Next to it, is a newly completed arrivals terminal for domestic flights, those that are operated by the national carrier to and from local airports like Kamembe in Rusizi or Rubavu, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to the Minister of infrastructure, Honorable Claver Gatete, the expansion works of the airport kicked off in September as part of the broader efforts to prepare for CHOGM, which was postponed due to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Runways&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The surface, strength and general condition of the parking area is good. There is sufficient lighting, and the markings are clear.
