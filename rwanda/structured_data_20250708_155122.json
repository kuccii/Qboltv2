The consumption of petroleum in Rwanda stands at 23 million litres per month. This constitutes about 20% of total national imports and has been steadily rising in the past five years, with an average annual increase of 12 per cent.\nThe main policy objective for the sub-sector is to ensure safe, sufficient, reliable, sustainable and affordable supply of petroleum product. This entails boosting investments in supply and storage infrastructure.\nIn order to address current sub-sector challenges, the Rwanda Energy Policy reinforces the implementation of existing sub-sector policies through the following objectives:\nAccelerate regional cooperation and strategic infrastructure development to reduce the costs of procurement, transportation and storage of petroleum products.\nProject:\nEldoret-Kampala-Kigali petroleum pipeline: the Governments of Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda have agreed   to promote investment for the extension of petroleum pipeline from Eldoret in Kenya to Kampala and Kigali. Feasibility study has been commissioned in 2014. Fund mobilization through the private sector is ongoing.\nEnsure security of petroleum supply by ensuring adequate storage infrastructure and adequate strategic reserves:\nEnsure adequate storage infrastructure: currently Rwanda petroleum storage infrastructure essentially consists of government and private sector owned fuel depots equivalent to 72,000,000 litres as per table below:\nThe downstream infrastructure of petroleum including storage depots, petrol service stations, import transmission, distribution, and trade of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is regulated by RURA.\nAdditional information on the role of RURA can be obtained on the\nRwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority Website\n.\nThe oil companies are required to keep 10,000 m³ of operational stock to ensure that there is sufficient petroleum supply within the country. Storage facilities are located at: Kigali, Gisenyi, Gatsatsa, and Butare. There are three facilities of 3,660 m³ each at Gatsatsa and two facilities of 1,950 m³ at Butare.\nFor more info on fuel transport, fuel price and fuel depots, please visit the\nRwanda Ministry of Trade and Industry Website\n.\nFor more information on government and fuel provider contact details, please see the following links:\n4.1 Government Contact List\nInformation may also be found at:\nhttp://www.mytravelcost.com/petrol-prices/\nwhich is updated monthly.\nFuel Pricing\nFuel prices are regulated by the Government of Rwanda through the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA), which has the mandate to regulate certain public Utilities, namely: telecommunications network and/or services, electricity, water, removal of waste products from residential or business premises, extraction and distribution of gas and transport of goods and persons.\nThe price of other petroleum products is not controlled. The government's oil price policy is used to keep the selling prices constant while adapting the level of taxation to compensate for changes in the world market.\nAs of 16 September 2022, the average price of diesel and gasoline around the world is 1.29 US$ / litre. (Source:\nGlobal Petrol Prices\n)\nFuel Prices per Litre as of 22092022\n(Local currency and USD - $)\nPetrol\n1,609 Rwf / 1.56 US$\nDiesel\n1,607 Rwf / 1.56 US$\nParaffin\n400.54 Rwf/ 0.388 US$\nJet A-1\n3137 Rwf/ $3.04 US$\nSeasonal Variations\nVariations in supply may occur if there are problems with the supply or availability of fuel from the fuel sourcing countries: Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.\nSeasonal Variations\nAre there national priorities in the availability of fuel? (i.e. are there restrictions or priorities for the provision of fuel such as to the military?)\nYes\nIs there a rationing system?\nNo\nIs fuel to lower income / vulnerable groups subsidized?\nNo\nCan the local industry expand fuel supply to meet humanitarian needs?\nYes\nIs it possible for a humanitarian organization to directly contract a reputable supplier / distributor to provide its fuel needs?\nYes\nFuel Transportation\nInternal transportation of fuel in Rwanda is carried out by trucks from Kenya (Nairobi and Eldoret) and Dar es Salaam. The supply is relatively constant and can meet the local demand. However, there have been reports of limited storage capacity for fuel in the country. To address that issue, the Government partnered with private oil dealers to have reserves of up to 150 million litres. In 2015, Societe Petroliere LTD has completed the construction of 21 million litres capacity in Rusororo Sector, Gasabo District, in Kigali where the inland terminal for the proposed Eldoret-Kampala-Kigali pipeline for refined petroleum products will be located. Other companies that have already embarked on storage construction include Abbarci Petroleum Marketing (ABBARCI), Oryx Petroleum, Protek and Mont Meru Petroleum Rwanda. The existing capacity 30 million litres will be significantly increased by the year 2017.

Overview&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, Rwanda imports all its petroleum products requirements from abroad since there is no local production. The consumption of petroleum in Rwanda stands at 23 million litres per month. This constitutes about 20% of total national imports and has been steadily rising in the past five years, with an average annual increase of 12 per cent.&nbsp;<br>\nThe main policy objective for the sub-sector is to ensure safe, sufficient, reliable, sustainable and affordable supply of petroleum product. This entails boosting investments in supply and storage infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to address current sub-sector challenges, the Rwanda Energy Policy reinforces the implementation of existing sub-sector policies through the following objectives:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Accelerate regional cooperation and strategic infrastructure development to reduce the costs of procurement, transportation and storage of petroleum products.&nbsp;<br>\nProject:&nbsp;<br>\nEldoret-Kampala-Kigali petroleum pipeline: the Governments of Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda have agreed&nbsp;&nbsp; to promote investment for the extension of petroleum pipeline from Eldoret in Kenya to Kampala and Kigali. Feasibility study has been commissioned in 2014. Fund mobilization through the private sector is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ensure security of petroleum supply by ensuring adequate storage infrastructure and adequate strategic reserves:&nbsp;<br>\nEnsure adequate storage infrastructure: currently Rwanda petroleum storage infrastructure essentially consists of government and private sector owned fuel depots equivalent to 72,000,000 litres as per table below:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The downstream infrastructure of petroleum including storage depots, petrol service stations, import transmission, distribution, and trade of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is regulated by RURA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Additional information on the role of RURA can be obtained on the <a href=\"http://www.rura.rw/index.php?id=95\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority Website</a>.   &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The oil companies are required to keep 10,000 m³ of operational stock to ensure that there is sufficient petroleum supply within the country. Storage facilities are located at: Kigali, Gisenyi, Gatsatsa, and Butare. There are three facilities of 3,660 m³ each at Gatsatsa and two facilities of 1,950 m³ at Butare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more info on fuel transport, fuel price and fuel depots, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.minicom.gov.rw/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rwanda Ministry of Trade and Industry Website</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more information on government and fuel provider contact details, please see the following links: <a href=\"https://dlca.logcluster.org/display/DLCA/4.1+Rwanda+Government+Contact+List\" target=\"_blank\">4.1 Government Contact List</a></p>\n\n<p>Information may also be found at: <a href=\"http://www.mytravelcost.com/petrol-prices/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mytravelcost.com/petrol-prices/</a> which is updated monthly. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Fuel Pricing&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Fuel prices are regulated by the Government of Rwanda through the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA), which has the mandate to regulate certain public Utilities, namely: telecommunications network and/or services, electricity, water, removal of waste products from residential or business premises, extraction and distribution of gas and transport of goods and persons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The price of other petroleum products is not controlled. The government's oil price policy is used to keep the selling prices constant while adapting the level of taxation to compensate for changes in the world market. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As of 16 September 2022, the average price of diesel and gasoline around the world is 1.29 US$ / litre.

The supply is relatively constant and can meet the local demand. However, there have been reports of limited storage capacity for fuel in the country. To address that issue, the Government partnered with private oil dealers to have reserves of up to 150 million litres. In 2015, Societe Petroliere LTD has completed the construction of 21 million litres capacity in Rusororo Sector, Gasabo District, in Kigali where the inland terminal for the proposed Eldoret-Kampala-Kigali pipeline for refined petroleum products will be located. Other companies that have already embarked on storage construction include Abbarci Petroleum Marketing (ABBARCI), Oryx Petroleum, Protek and Mont Meru Petroleum Rwanda. The existing capacity 30 million litres will be significantly increased by the year 2017.
