However, about small and not so busy border posts, the Customs officer might not be found at any time during the day. The gazetted overland border posts for heavy vehicles where Rwanda Customs, Police and Immigration at present are as follows:\nBORDER POST\nLOCATION\nEXIT/ENTRY POINT\nKagitumba\nNorth\nUganda\nGatuna\nNorth\nUganda\nNemba\nEast\nBurundi\nRusumo\nEast\nTanzania\nAkanyaru\nSouth\nBurundi\nGisenyi (La corniche & Petite\nWest\nDRC\nCyangugu (Rusiizi II & Ruhwa)\nWest\nDRC\nTransit Charges\nThere is a road-toll charge for foreign registered trucks entering Rwanda of $152 per trip, additional to this is a charge of RWF 15,000 ($27) RWF 5,000 ($9.00) which is referred to as the Entry Card Charge for foreign trucks with a non EAC registration number plate e.g. DRC.\nThe charge for presenting customs documentation is RWF 6,000 ($10) RWF 3,000 ($5.50). There is also a $200 bond charge but there is no requirement for WFP to pay this.\nStorage and Handling at Overland Border Posts\nDepending on the nature and the physical location of WFP operations at the time, the storage facility of the nearest town or WFP EDP could be considered as an alternative to the border post storage, regarding the borders that do not have a storage facility, for instance:\nLocation\nDistance to Border (kms)\nCapacity (Mt)\nDescription\nByumba (Gatuna)\n30\n12,000\nNew secure warehouse operated by Pembe Flour Mills\nAlternative Border Storage Options\nGenerally, the storage facilities are not up to the WFP standards. Therefore, there may be a need for repair and rehabilitation works before use.\nInspection Procedures\nTrucks arriving at the border crossing points are checked for appropriateness of documentation and sample checks of the cargo type can be conducted as per international standards and procedures. Rwanda accepts and uses ESW (Electronic Single Window) ASYCUDA (Automatic System for Customs Data); this enables clearance to be kept to a minimum, sometimes as little as only 10 mins.\nCustoms documents are filled at the entry points and a general inspection is undertaken before trucks are allowed to continue to their destination. Truck movements are monitored by the Anti-Smuggling Unit at each checkpoint until they reach their destination. The Anti-Smuggling Unit evaluates the time trucks spend between checkpoints to check if there was any diversion on the way.\nAvailable Facilities\nThe border crossing points that are also regional towns (Gisenyi & Cyangugu) all have adequate facilities that drivers require. The other crossing points are not near major towns have basic facilities such as food and lodging, small retail shops, and standby security personnel.\nBook Navigation\nRwanda - 1.2 Regulatory Departments & Quality Control\nRwanda - 2 Logistics Infrastructure\nContact\nAbout the LCA tool\n© 2025.
